I am creating This full-stack web application for Arda and Evin Kisakurek couple. Mr. Arda wrote 28 books with the help of Mrs. Evin about Human History. This webpage will carry some information about Mr. and Mrs. Kisakurek, and the users will have access to their books in PDF format. 

Technology Stack
Front-end: React (JavaScript), Bootstrap
Back-end: Node.js/ Express.js (JavaScript)
Databases: IBM Cloud Object Storage and MongoDB Atlas


1) Created IBM Cloud Object Storage to store the books in PDF format. Allowed public viewing to get public URLs for each of the books.

2) Uploaded the URLs to MongoDB.

3) Created the backend logic to request books' public URLs.

4) Created a button to see if the backend route works correctly. (IT WORKS)

5) Trying to create a proxy server to mask my public object cloud storage URL but I am having troubles with that part soooooo for now we might skip it and focus on creating the UI.
